			        As instructors, we constantly strive to improve our lectures and the class as a
                                whole. We provide anonymous "Tiny Feedback" opportunities to approximately 10% of the
                                class after each lecture, and the feedback helps us guage how CS 106B is going
                                on a bit more personal level.
                                <p>
                                We very much appreciate constructive feedback, and we want to know what is working
                                and what you would like to see us do differently. We will make every attempt to 
                                improve the course as the quarter progresses.
                                <p>
                                Because of the anonymous nature of the feedback, we cannot reply directly to students,
                                which can be frustrating for both you and for us. So, we will use this page to 
                                make comments on the feedback ("feedback feedback," as it were). We can't always
                                make the requested changes because of curricular restrictions and time constraits,
                                but we don't want you to feel that your feedback is going into a black hole, never
                                to be seen again. Trust us, we read every submission!
                                <p>
                                Furthermore, sometimes there are conflicting requests, and we may want to explain
                                why we are making the choices we are about this course. This is an iterative process
                                (see what we did there?), and we want to explain what changes we are making, and why.

                                what we could improve here </b>-- please don't think we just get negative feedback. :)

                                        <li><b>"More about the assignment" </b>-- it is tough to provide too much detail about
                                                the assignment during class, due to time constraints. But, we will
                                                always give at least an overview in class, and we will have YEAH
                                                hours that will be taped and put online. You can also go to CLaIR hours,
                                                which are designed to help with conceptual issues for assignements.</li>
                                        <li><b>"There was a lot of material -- it's rushed!" </b>-- We have a ton of material to
                                                cover in 10 weeks. Sometimes, we are too ambitious about what we can
                                                go over in class. We will work on pacing during lectures.</li>
                                        <li><b>"It might be nice to be able to follow along a bit more interactively
                                                in terms of coding in class," "More coding in class!" "More pieces of
                                                code in class," (about 10 more similar sentiments) </b>-- Wow. You want
                                                more code in class! This is a tricky one, because code takes time to 
                                                write and process. If we have more code examples in class, we won't
                                                be able to give some of the conceptual material the time it needs.
                                                But, we will look at this and see what we can do. One idea might be
                                                to have some extra code examples in other videos, where we can 
                                                take the time, and where you can pause the video, etc.</li>
                                        <li><b>"We spend too much time in class on conceptual stuff" </b>-- Some CS 106B concepts are
                                                hard. We will quickly get into more in-depth material that really
                                                does take some explaining before we jump into coding with it.
                                                But (see the previous comment), we will try and find more ways
                                                to get more code examples to you.</li>
                                        <li><b>"Explain code stacks / queues / maps / sets more" </b>-- this is primarily a
                                                time limitation in class. But, sections are a <i>great</i> opportunity
                                                to talk in more detail about the ideas. Also, the book is a terrific
                                                reference. Finally, we almost always provide links to reference material
                                                at the end of the slides.</li>
                                        <li><b>"While I understand it's difficult with such a large class size, I wish there 
                                                was a little more interaction between the students and the professors
                                                during lecture" </b>-- we do, too! Large lectures are not the best way to learn,
                                                and we get that. We'll try to be more interactive with the class, but
                                                we also hope that you are getting a lot out of your sections, where there
                                                is more individual attention. Oh, and come to office hours to say "hi!"</li>
                                        <li><b>"I would have liked more time to be spent on the examples rather than the 
                                                definitions and theory; I just think the examples are more efficient 
                                                in helping understand the role of stacks/queues in the larger world of 
                                                computer science as well as their respective mechanisms." </b>-- we'll try 
                                                to get more examples in class, but once we dig a bit deeper, we will need
                                                to cover the concepts enough so that why we are writing the code we do
                                                actually makes sense (and you understand it).</li>
                                        <li><b>"By making lots of references to scifi, you perpetuate the stereotype that people who like CS = people who like scifi (and traditional, mainstream, white-male-dominated scifi). There is already a cultural script that the people who "do CS" are, by and large, white and male and a certain brand of nerdy. Stanford, especially in its intro classes, should be doing all it can to make people from of all backgrounds -- especially those historically underrepresented in the field -- feel that there is space for them in computer science. (You did that on the first day by sharing the story of the person who used technology to check counterfeit medication!)" </b>-- Thank you for the feedback.
                                                There is a lot to unpack here, and we do consciously try to give examples,
                                                homework problems, etc., that appeal to as many students as we can. We might
                                                disagree that we have "made lots of references to scifi" -- yes, we have made
                                                some, but we have also made references to literature, language, history, and others.
                                                But, your point is well-taken, and we will strive to do better.</li>
                                        <li><b>"Stop saying under the covers plz" </b>-- this caught us off-guard. We'll try to find better
                                                analogies.</li>
                                        <li><b>"The explanation of ADTs was not so clear" </b>-- sorry about that! If are explanations aren't
                                                clear, please ask us to clarify them in office hours, on Piazza, or at the LaIR.</li>
                                        <li><b>"I understand that there's a lot of material to cover in a really short amount of time, but sometimes it's just so overwhelming trying to retain all the topics covered in class. We're always moving on to another topic before I have the chance to really soak in the details of the prior concept, so I wish we could focus on fewer ideas at a time but in greater detail. "
                                                </b>-- Yes, we don't like it, either. Take in what you can during lecture, read the book, watch
                                                the video again (1.5x works well!), and ask questions in section, on Piazza and in LaIR.
                                                We know this class is fast and furious, but we hope you can get a lot out of the non-lecture
                                                portions of the class to make it work.</li>
                                        <li><b>"It'll be great if some comments can be added on the code" </b>-- we do need to "practice
                                                what we preach!" We will try and comment the example code better!</li>
                                        <li><b>"The slides seem a little verbose, or at least busy." </b>-- We will work on making the
                                                slides more clear. We do provide them online before class, so if you need more time
                                                with each slide, feel free to download them and/or print them.</li>
                                        <li><b>"I want to hear more about bananagrams!" </b>-- come to office hours! We love talking about
                                                banangrams!</li>
                                        <li><b>"There were times when I think too much time was spent on the metaphors. For example, the concept of a set is not that hard to grasp, so I think it would be a better use of time to demonstrate more applications."
                                                </b>-- We try to have a mix, as some people really get metaphors, and it can be
                                                a powerful tool. But, see above for how we will try and improve what we
                                                cover in lecture.</li>
                                        <li><b>"Spend more time on going over the methods of the ADTs" </b>-- Again, this is a time constraint issue.
                                                All of the ADTs are referenced in the book and online. One suggestion: read about the
                                                functions, and then try and code something that uses them! C++ classes do have a <i>ton</i>
                                                of functions, and it is cool to dig into them to see what they can do.</li>
                                        <li><b>"I wish there was a slight bit more explanation on the difference between hashset/hashmap vs. set/map besides just the speed difference. Wasn't entirely clear on ordered/not ordered distinction" </b>-- good point! We will cover the innards of both
                                                types of ADTs at a later date, and it will all become clear! :)</li>
                                        <li><b>"I would love some mention about the book. Should I be reading it or not?" Yes! While the book is
                                                not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that you read it. We always put the chapters
                                                we are covering in class on the slides and web page. Sometimes the book covers much more
