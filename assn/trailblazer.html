						This program displays various road maps and allows users to find the shortest path between any two nodes. For example, if the user loaded the Stanford map and selected a node at the top of the Oval and another node at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_student_housing#Governor.27s_Corner">FroSoCo</a>, your program should display the best route:

						If you click on any two nodes in the world, the program will find a path from the starting position to the ending position. As it does so, it will color the vertexes green and yellow based on the colors assigned to them by the algorithm. Once the path is found, the program will highlight it and display information about the path cost in the console. The user can select one of four path-searching algorithms in the top menu:
					</p>
					<ol>
						
						<li>Breadth-first search (BFS)</li>
						<li>Dijkstra's algorithm</li>
						<li>A* search</li>
						<li>Alternative Route</li>
					</ol>
					</p>



					<p>
						The window contains several controls. You can load world maps by selecting them from the bottom drop-down menu and then clicking the "Load" button.
					</p>
					<p>
						In your trailblazer.cpp file, you must write the following 4 functions for finding paths and creating mazes in a graph:
					</p>
<pre>Path breadthFirstSearch(RoadGraph& graph, Vertex* start, Vertex* end)</pre> 
<pre>Path dijkstrasAlgorithm(RoadGraph& graph, Vertex* start, Vertex* end)</pre>
<pre>Path aStar(RoadGraph& graph, Vertex* start, Vertex* end)</pre>
<pre>Path alternativeRoute(RoadGraph& graph, Vertex* start, Vertex* end)</pre>
					</p>

					<p>
						Each of the first three implements a path-searching algorithm taught in class. You should search the given graph for a path from the given start vertex to the given end vertex. If you find such a path, the path you return should be a list of all vertexes along that path, with the starting vertex first (index 0 of the vector) and the ending vertex last. </p>

						<p>
							A <code>Path</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typedef">typedef</a> of a <code>Vector&lt;Vertex *></code>. It is an alias for the same exact type.
					</p>

					<p>
						If no path is found, return an empty path. If the start and end vertexes are the same, return a one-element vector containing only that vertex. Though some graphs may be undirected (all edges go both ways), your code should not assume this. You may assume that the graph passed in is not corrupt.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our provided main client program will allow you to test each algorithm one at a time before moving on to the next. You can add more functions as helpers if you like, particularly to remove redundancy between some algorithms containing similar code.
					</p>

					<p>
						The road network world is represented by a RoadGraph, which is a thin wrapper around the BasicGraph we saw in class. Each vertex represents a specific location on the world.  An edge between two verticies means that there is a direct road between the two. The cost of the path is the time it takes to traverse that road. 
					</p>

					<p>Your algorithm should work on any RoadGraph instance, such as this map of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth">Middle Earth</a> that can help Frodo get from the Shire to Mount Doom:

						Coloring: In addition to searching for a path in each algorithm, we also want you to add some code to give colors to various vertexes at various times.  This coloring information is used by the GUI to show the progress of your algorithm and to provide the appearance of animation.  To give a color to a vertex, call the color member function on that vertex's Vertex object, passing it a global color constant such as GRAY, YELLOW, or GREEN.  For example:
					

<pre>// set the start vertex's color to green
start->setColor(GREEN);</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						Here is a listing of colors available and when you should use them:
						<ul>
							<li>enqueued = yellow: Whenever you enqueue a vertex to be visited for the first time, such as in BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm when you add a vertex to a data structure for later processing, color it yellow (YELLOW).</li>
							<li>visited = green: Whenever your algorithm directly visits and examines a particular vertex, such as when it is dequeued from the processing queue in BFS, color it green (GREEN).</li>
							
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						The provided GUI has an animation slider that you can drag to set a delay between coloring calls.  If the slider is not all the way to its left edge, each call to setColor on a vertex will pause the GUI briefly, causing the appearance of animation so that you can watch your algorithms run.

						See the <a href="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172/assnFiles/trailblazer/output/">expected output files</a> for reference on what your program should do.

But you do not need to exactly match our path itself, nor its "locations visited", so long as your path is a correct one

					<p>Check out the <a href="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172//handouts/search.html">search handout</a> for an example of the search algorithms. Each of the three search algorithms (BFS, Dijkstra, A*) follow the general paradigm:</p>

					<p>
						<b>Breadth-first search implementation notes:</b> Implement the version of the algorithm pseudo-code from lecture. Make sure to keep track of nodes that you have already visited.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Dijkstra's algorithm implementation notes:</b> The version of Dijkstra that we talk about in class is slightly different than the version in the book. Your implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm can follow any version. The one we talked about in lecture is probably the easiest. The priority queue should store paths, and once you find a path that ends in the destination, you should reconstruct the shortest path back.  See the lecture slides for more details.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						<b>A* implementation notes:</b> As discussed in class, the A* search algorithm is essentially a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses heuristics to fine-tune the order of elements in its priority queue to explore more likely desirable elements first.  So when you are implementing A*, you need a heuristic function to incorporate into the algorithm.  
					</p>

					<p>
						You can compare the behavior of Dijkstra's algorithm and A* (or any pair of algorithms).  First try performing a search between two points using Dijkstra's algorithm, then select A* and press the "Run" button at the top of the GUI window.  This will repeat the same search using the currently selected algorithm.  Run a search using Dijkstra's algorithm, switch the algorithm choice to "A*," then run that search to see how much more efficient A* is.
					</p>


					<hr/>
				<h2>
					<a >
						A* Heuristic
					</a>
				</h2>

					<p>In order for A* to work, you need to define a <i>heuristic</i> function which under-estimates the cost of travelling between two vertices.</p>

					<p>
						For a road map (where cost is travel time), a simple heuristic is to calculate the time it would take to get between the nodes assuming that there was a direct super highway between the two nodes. If the speed of a super highway is as fast or faster than the speed on any road then the algorithm will underestimate the true graph distance (which makes it an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic">admissable heuristic</a>). To calculate how long it would take to travel along a super highway between two nodes use the two RoadGraph functions: <code>getCrowFlyDistance</code> and <code>getMaxRoadSpeed</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recall that traveTime = distance / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed#Definition">speed</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your A* search algorithm should always return a path with the same length and cost as the path found by Dijkstra's algorithm.  If you find that the algorithms give paths of different costs, it probably indicates a bug in your solution.

						Alternative Route

				</h2>
				<div style="display:block" id="algo">

					<p>When travelling between two points on a road map, you may want to take the fastest route, but if there is a reasonable alternative you might prefer that instead. For example, though highway 101 is often slightly faster way to get to San Francisco, highway 280 is more beautiful (Chris Gregg thinks that you should also consider going all the way to highway 1). Your final task is to implement the <code>alternativeRoute</code> function. </p>

					<p>In this example the shortest path between the oval and the back of MemChu is shown in red, and a next best alternative is shown in blue:</p>

					</p>

					<p>
						We already know how to find a shorest path from a start to a goal. How do we find an alternate route?
					<p>
					To find an alternate path from a start node to an end node, first we are going to calculate the best (aka shortet) path between start and end. Then, for each edge in the best path we are going to calculate the shortest path from start to end that ignores that edge. Each search will return a candidate "alternate route". Your function should return the lowest cost alternate route that is sufficiently different from the original best path. 

					<p>
                                        The difference of an alternate path P from the best path B is defined to be the number of nodes that are in B, but are not in P divided by the number of nodes in P:
                                        </p>

                                        There are different ways to accomplish the modification to your path algorithm.
                                        One option is to simply write a separate and modified Dijkstra
                                        or A* function that has the ability to ignore an edge.
                                        While this option is allowed for your project, it does duplicate a lot of code.
                                        A better option would be to <i>refactor</i> your code and write a modified function 
                                        that performs Dijstra or A* and can either
                                        perform the standard algorithm <i>or</i> can ignore a given edge. Then, modify your original
                                        Dijkstra or A* function to simply call your new function.

						Your final task in this assignment is to implement Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree.  Your function should accept a graph as a parameter, and you should return a set of pointers to edges in the graph such that those edges would connect the graph's vertexes into a minimum spanning tree.  (Don't actually add/remove edges from the graph object passed in by calling addEdge, removeEdge, etc. on it.  Just return the set of edges separately.)  Specifically, your task is to write a function with the following signature:
					</p>
					<p>
						<pre>Set<Edge*> kruskal(BasicGraph& graph)</pre>
					</p>
					<p>Recall the pseudocode for Kruskal's algorithm from lecture:</p>
					<p>
						<pre>kruskal(graph):
    Place each vertex into its own "cluster" (group of reachable vertexes).
    Put all edges into a priority queue, using weights as priorities.
    While there are two or more separate clusters remaining:
        Dequeue an edge e from the priority queue.
        If the start and finish vertexes of e are not in the same cluster:
            Merge the clusters containing the start and finish vertexes of e.
            Add e to your spanning tree.
    Once the while loop terminates, your spanning tree is complete.</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						The specific application we'll Kruskal's algorithm to solve is the problem of generating new random mazes.  As discussed earlier in this handout, you can think of a maze as a graph, where the vertexes are connected as follows.  The following figure would be a fully connected maze with no walls:
					</p>
					<p>
						<center>
							<img style="width:40%" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172/img/assn/trailblazer/grid.png">
						</center>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you assign each edge a random weight and then run Kruskal's algorithm on the resulting graph, you will end up with a spanning tree; there will be exactly one path between each pair of vertexes.  For example, assigning the edges in the above graph weights as follows and running Kruskal's algorithm would produce the following result:
					</p>
					<p>

						</center>
					</p>
					<p>In the above tree, lines represent edges between connected neighbors, which are passable.  Neighbors that are not connected by an edge can be thought of as having an impassable "wall" between them.  You can turn the above tree into a maze by drawing lines in all of the empty space, as shown here:

						Whenever you click the GUI's "Load" button with one of the "Random" options selected, our starter code will generate a maze of the given size with every vertex connected to all of its neighbors, as in the "fully connected" maze figure above.  Our code will randomly assign weights to each edge for you; you shouldn't change the weights we pass in.  Then we will pass the graph to your algorithm for you to find the minimum spanning tree.  Once you return your set of edges, our starter code will process your set and fill in "walls" between any neighbors that are not directly connected by an edge.  The resulting maze will show in the GUI.  Once you've made a maze, you can run your path-finding algorithms to locate paths between points in the maze.  Implementing this function raises questions such as:
						<ol>
							<li>How will you keep track of which nodes are in each cluster?</li>
							<li>How will you determine which cluster a node belongs to?</li>
							<li>How will you merge together two clusters?</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						Think about these issues yourself and come up with a clean and efficient way of solving the problem.  Our own sample solution is able to generate "Large" sized mazes in a few seconds' time at most, and you should strive for similar efficiency.  If your maze generation algorithm takes, say, close to a minute or more to finish, optimize it.
					</p>
					<p>
						For Kruskal's algorithm (described next), your code must find a valid minimum spanning tree on the given graph.  If there are several of equal total weight, any will suffice.

						Though your solution to this assignment must match all of the specifications mentioned previously, it is allowed and encouraged for you to add extra features to your program if you'd like to go beyond the basic assignment. Here are some example ideas for extra features that you could add to your program.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Implement bidirectional search:</b>  A common alternative to using A* search is to use a bidirectional search algorithm, in which you search outward from both the start and end vertexes simultaneously.  As soon as the two searches find a vertex in common, you can construct a path from the start vertex to the end vertex by joining the two paths to that vertex together.  Try coding this algorithm up as a fifth algorithm choice.</li>
						<li><b>Better alternate:</b>  The alternate route algorithm is slow and not garunteed to find the best alternate. Can you come up with a different algorithm that is (hopefully) faster or uses a more realistic measure of path distance.</li>
						<li><b>Add more data from open maps:</b>  We generated the maps from openstreetmaps.org. In the graphs you see we added some nodes and edges, but let out a lot of interesting information (like street names and building). <a href="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172/assnFiles/trailblazer/open-map-converter">Here is a link</a> to a folder with all of the raw openstreetmap data. Do anything you like with it. Can you print out direction? We haven't tried yet but it seems interesting!</li>
						<!--<li><b>Add more data from open maps:</b>  The alternate route algorithm is slow and not garunteed to find the best alternate. Can you come up with a different algorithm that is (hopefully) faster or uses a more realistic measure of path distance.</li>-->
						<!--<li><b>Implement a disjoint-set forest:</b>  When implementing Kruskal's algorithm, you need a way to keep track of which vertexes in the graph are connected to one another.  While it's possible to do this using the standard collections types, there is an extremely simple and much faster way to do this using a disjoint-set forest, a specialized data structure that makes it easy to determine if two vertexes are connected and to connect pairs of vertexes.  It is not particularly hard to code up a disjoint-set forest, and doing so can dramatically reduce time required to create a maze.</li>
						<li><b>Make a new world type:</b>  The existing code has several classes that extend a superclass World to represent maps, mazes, and terrains.  Add your own new subclass for a type of world that we didn't include.</li>
						<li><b>Write better heuristics: </b> The heuristics we have provided for estimating terrain costs and map / maze distances are simple admissible heuristics that work reasonably well.  Try seeing if you can modify these functions to produce more accurate heuristics.  If you do this correctly, you can cut down on the amount of unnecessary searching required.  However, make sure that your heuristics are admissible; that is, they should never overestimate the distance from any starting vertex to any destination vertex.</li>
						<li><b>Choose a different maze-generation algorithm: </b> Kruskal's algorithm is only one of many ways to generate a random maze.  Another minimum spanning tree algorithm called Prim's algorithm can also be used here to generate random mazes.  Try adding Prim's algorithm in addition to Kruskal's algorithm for maze generation.  Can you generate more complicated mazes and maps?</li>
						<li><b>Write a better terrain generator:  </b>Our starter code generates terrain uses the diamond-square algorithm, coupled with a Gaussian blur.  Many other algorithms exist that can generate random terrains, such as the 2D Perlin Noise algorithm.  Try implementing a different terrain generator and see if it produces better results.</li>-->
						<li><b>Other:</b> If you have your own creative idea for an extra feature, go for it!</li>
					</ol>
					<h4 class="secondHeading">Indicating that you have done extra features:</h4>
					<p>
						 If you complete any extra features, then in the comment heading on the top of your program, please list all extra features that you worked on and where in the code they can be found (what functions, lines, etc. so that the grader can look at their code easily).
					</p>
					<h4 class="secondHeading">Submitting a program with extra features:</h4>
					<p>Since we use automated testing for part of our grading process, it is important that you submit a program that conforms to the preceding spec, even if you want to do extra features. If your feature(s) cause your program to change the output that it produces in such a way that it no longer matches the expected sample output test cases provided, you should submit two versions of your program file: a first one named life.cpp without any extra features added (or with all necessary features disabled or commented out), and a second one named life-extra.cpp with the extra features enabled. Please distinguish them in by explaining which is which in the comment header. Our turnin system saves every submission you make, so if you make multiple submissions we will be able to view all of them; your previously submitted files will not be lost or overwritten.</p>
